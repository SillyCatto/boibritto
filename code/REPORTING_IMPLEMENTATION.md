# Blog Reporting System Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented the frontend reporting functionality for the blogs page (`/blogs/[id]`) following the API specification provided. The implementation includes a complete report system with proper UI/UX design that matches the existing application theme.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `lib/reportsAPI.ts` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: API client for handling report submissions and retrieval
- **Features**:
  - TypeScript interfaces for type safety (`ReportData`, `Report`, `ReportsResponse`)
  - Authentication handling with Firebase tokens
  - Error handling with proper error messages
  - Support for all required report types and reasons
  - Pagination support for user's reports

### 2. `components/ui/ReportModal.tsx` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Modal component for reporting content
- **Features**:
  - Clean, accessible modal design
  - All 11 report reasons as specified in the API
  - Form validation with error handling
  - Character limit (200) for description field
  - Loading states and success feedback
  - Disclaimer about false reports
  - Responsive design

### 3. `app/blogs/[id]/page.tsx` (MODIFIED)
- **Purpose**: Updated blog viewing page to include reporting functionality
- **Changes**:
  - Added report button for non-author users
  - Integrated ReportModal component
  - Proper conditional rendering (only shows for authenticated users who aren't the author)
  - Maintains existing design consistency

## Key Features Implemented

### Report Submission
- **Target Type**: `blog` (as specified in the API)
- **All Report Reasons Supported**:
  - spam
  - harassment
  - hate_speech
  - violence
  - adult_content
  - copyright_violation
  - misinformation
  - self_harm
  - bullying
  - impersonation
  - other

### User Experience
- **Smart Button Visibility**: Report button only appears for:
  - Authenticated users
  - Users who are NOT the blog author
- **Professional UI**: Flag icon with red styling to indicate reporting
- **Form Validation**: Ensures reason is selected before submission
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for failed submissions
- **Success Feedback**: Confirmation message after successful report
- **Duplicate Prevention**: API handles duplicate report prevention

### Security & Authentication
- **Firebase Integration**: Uses existing Firebase auth system
- **Token-based Authentication**: Secure API calls with user tokens
- **Authorization**: Proper user permission checks

## API Integration
The implementation follows the exact API specification provided:

```javascript
// Request Format
POST /api/reports
{
  "targetType": "blog",
  "targetId": "blog_id_here", 
  "reason": "spam",
  "description": "Optional description"
}

// Response Format
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Report submitted successfully",
  "data": {
    "reportId": "report_id_here",
    // ... other fields
  }
}
```

## Error Handling
- **400 Bad Request**: Form validation prevents invalid submissions
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication errors handled gracefully
- **409 Conflict**: Duplicate report errors shown to user
- **404 Not Found**: Content not found errors handled

## Design Consistency
- **Theme Integration**: Matches existing amber color scheme
- **Typography**: Consistent with existing font weights and sizes
- **Spacing**: Follows established padding/margin patterns
- **Icons**: Uses same Heroicons library as rest of the application
- **Transitions**: Smooth hover effects and state changes

## Future Enhancements
The current implementation provides a solid foundation that can be extended with:
- Report status tracking for users
- Admin dashboard integration
- Bulk reporting functionality
- Report analytics

The system is now fully functional and ready for testing with the backend API.
